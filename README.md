# Note++

This is a note app inspired by the minecraft book and quill 

Note ++ is the name of the web app, and it was completed in a group project during the All Star Code Summer Intensive as a part of Demo Day

This project allows users to submit entries to a notebook, and the entries will be saved upon clicking the save button on the side of the book. 

A firebase database was used to assit in saving the writing data 

More buttons to customize writing entries such as bolding, italics, and random colorization are also added to the side of the notbook.
